Install
=====

An API key from [football-data.org](http://api.football-data.org/) will be required and you can register for one [here](http://api.football-data.org/client/register).


### Build from source

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/architv/soccer-cli.git
$ cd soccer-cli
$ python setup.py install
```

You can set the API key using an environment variable as shown above or create a file `.soccer-cli.ini` in your home folder (`/home/username/.soccer-cli.ini`) that contains only your API token, such that:

```bash
$ cat /home/username/.soccer-cli.ini
<YOUR_API_TOKEN>
```

#### Note:
Currently supports Linux, Mac OS X, NetBSD, FreeBSD and Windows.

To get colorized terminal output on Windows, make sure to install [ansicon](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/releases/latest) and [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/).
